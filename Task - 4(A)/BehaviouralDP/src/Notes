To design and implement a logging system in Java that processes log messages of different severity levels using the Chain of Responsibility, Command, and Iterator design patterns, we will follow the detailed requirements provided. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Define an enum LogLevel to represent the severity levels
2. Command Interface
3. LogCommand Class
4. LogHandler Abstract Class
5. Concrete Handlers for Each Severity Level
InfoHandler
DebugHandler
ErrorHandler
6. Logger Class
7. Main/App Class
Explanation:
LogLevel Enum: Defines the severity levels INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.

Command Interface: Declares the execute method.

LogCommand Class: Implements the Command interface, holding the log level and message.

LogHandler Abstract Class: Defines the chain of responsibility. Each handler can process the log message or pass it to the next handler.

Concrete Handlers: InfoHandler, DebugHandler, and ErrorHandler implement LogHandler, processing messages of their respective severity levels.

Logger Class: Maintains a list of Command objects and uses an iterator to process them.

Client Class: Configures the chain of responsibility, creates commands, and processes log messages.

This implementation provides a flexible and maintainable logging system using the Chain of Responsibility, Command, and Iterator design patterns.
